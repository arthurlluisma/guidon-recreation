                  At the forefront of The GUIDON, News is committed to
                  chronicling all relevant events and developments within the
                  Loyola Schools to consistently keep the Ateneo community up to
                  date. Writing for News entails immediate documentation of—and
                  response to—the Ateneo’s most pressing issues through print
                  and online stories. Serving all sectors of the Ateneo, News
                  staffers are tasked with reporting and unraveling the truth
                  behind campus issues and events. With this, they are expected
                  to think critically and creatively to produce newsworthy
                  stories without sacrificing quality, credibility, and ethics.

                  The concept of sports transcends numbers and recreation. It is
                  a haven for unscripted storylines, unlocked personalities, and
                  an increased platform for everyone involved in the industry.
                  In its pursuit of the truth, the mission of The GUIDON Sports
                  is to bring all of these mentioned elements into the screens
                  and broadsheets, providing its audience with well-molded
                  stories that are both entertaining and relevant to the Ateneo
                  and Philippine contexts.

                  Dedicated to unmasking covert realities, Inquiry is committed
                  to delivering data-driven and humanized narratives that delve
                  into the prevalent and deep-rooted phenomena within the Ateneo
                  and Katipunan. As The GUIDON’s investigative arm, the staff
                  seeks to explain relatively unknown issues and bring them
                  closer to the Atenean sensibility. With the goal of looking
                  deeper into the truth, Inquiry staffers must be dauntless in
                  writing critical stories that matter to the Ateneo community.
                  They aspire to be effective writers determined to probe
                  relevant issues through in-depth analysis and empathetic
                  storytelling.

                  Through its timely reportage of diverse and underserved
                  realities outside the University, Beyond Loyola situates the
                  Filipino in their local and global contexts through careful
                  analysis of the cultural, political, and economic forces
                  shaping the state of our nation. As such, the staff seeks to
                  maintain constant social awareness and spark relevant
                  discourse in matters relevant to the Filipino and, in
                  particular, the Atenean, as they become individuals for and
                  with others.

                  Dedicated to human-centric storytelling, Features delves into
                  phenomena rooted in the underlying nexus of the private and
                  public. The staff probes into personal accounts in its
                  commitment to document existing sociocultural realities and
                  contexts in a manner that is relevant in both concept and
                  effect. As the staff aims to humanize society’s cultural
                  trends, our writers endeavor to creatively present facts
                  through impactful stories grounded in experience. In their
                  pursuit of truth, staffers strive to highlight
                  underrepresented voices and sidelined narratives.

                  compelling stories, engaging discussions, and creative
                  expressions on Atenean campus culture and beyond. With a firm
                  grasp of multimedia storytelling and all things Ateneo,
                  Vantage Magazine celebrates creative expression balanced with
                  responsible storytelling.

                  Through the use of the audio-visual medium, Broadcast News
                  aims to amplify voices and capture human-centric stories
                  highlighting relevant social issues. The staff’s content
                  includes voiceover reports, podcasts, live coverages, and
                  short-form interviews. As the face and voice of The GUIDON’s
                  on-screen appearances, the staff’s nature is highly
                  collaborative with the other staffs within the publication.
                  Our reporters are trained to be conversational storytellers
                  with multimedia literacy through writing scripts, crafting
                  media outputs, interviewing key figures in society, and
                  reporting on breaking news within and beyond the Ateneo.

                  The Social Media staff is in charge of all of The GUIDON’s
                  online platforms. We oversee the publication of digital
                  content to ensure that everything is of utmost quality before
                  its release. As the truth grows hazier amid a turbulent
                  digital landscape, our commitment to the accurate
                  dissemination of news remains more steadfast than ever. We
                  actively search for patterns online that can help amplify The
                  GUIDON's digital presence. Moreover, we use data-driven
                  insights to not only assist The GUIDON’s writers and designers
                  in improving their content, but also to keep the Ateneo
                  community and beyond updated on stories that matter to them.

                  issues. Externals staffers are highly motivated and
                  detail-oriented team players. They are expected to think

                  releasing its own content that aligns with the organization’s

                  Track and the Content Development Track. Research Analysts

                  publication’s internal processes and adapt to the growing
                  demands of journalism. Meanwhile, Research Writers directly
                  contribute to the publication by providing qualitative and
                  quantitative data to reinforce the Writing Cluster, as well as
                  releasing their own articles concerning relevant matters in
                  the fields of Research and Development as well as Science and
                  Technology.

                  in charge of creating dynamic press broadsheets and diverse

                  the Graphic Design staff to connect with The GUIDON’s readers
                  beyond words, whether on print or online. Through the joint

                  Graphic Design staff is able to fulfill its duty of

                  The Photos staff is The GUIDON’s premier photojournalistic
                  arm, manned by visual storytellers who aspire to shed light on
                  today’s vast societal realities. Its staffers take photographs
                  that capture the human experience, bringing the truth to life.
                  Alongside the rest of the cluster, the staff plays an integral
                  role in visually engaging the audience through purposeful and
                  skillful photos. The vision of the Photos staff is to be at
                  the forefront of student journalism by amplifying the stories
                  of communities within and beyond the Ateneo. The staff
                  achieves this by being human-centric photojournalists who use
                  creative and impactful visual storytelling to chronicle the
                  events relevant to the community.

                  The Video Production staff is at the forefront of the
                  publication's shift to multimedia journalism. They are
                  responsible for creating storyboards and producing videos that
                  captivate viewers with impactful storytelling and cinematic
                  videography. Through their work, they bring the narratives
                  that matter to the audience, taking them on a visual journey

                  latest style trends. The Video Production staff produces
                  projects through their Content Strategists and Technical
                  Producers, who collaborate with each other to craft authentic
                  narratives that amplify the voices of communities. They also
                  work alongside other staffs’ writers, photographers, and
                  designers to ensure a seamless integration of visuals and
                  content, delivering a compelling storytelling experience. By
                  combining their expertise in videography techniques and
                  attention to detail, the staff releases videos that engage
                  viewers and offer a platform for diverse perspectives across
                  the publication's three platforms: The GUIDON, Vantage
                  Magazine, and GUIDON Sports.
